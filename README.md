This app was initially created for my friend who was coming to visit me in Maui HI.  The object was to have a platform to show him all that he did on the Island.

Functionality:
  - Todos
  - Hikes
  - Posts/Comments/Likes/Unlikes
  - Pictures (not completed)
  - Location Map of areas visited (not completed)

Wasnt able to finish for his visit, so I instead just made it into a Maui social media app.
